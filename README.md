# Project Title
🌦️ Weather App (API + Retrofit + Lottie)

A beginner-friendly Android app built in Kotlin that **fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API** and displays it with a clean, XML-based UI. It uses **Retrofit** for API calls, **GSON** for JSON parsing, and **Lottie animations** to show dynamic weather effects. This project showcases my learning of API integration, real-time data handling, and animated UI components in Android. 🚀
